# DEEPX DX-Compiler

## DXNN® - DEEPX NPU SDK (DX-AS: DEEPX All-Suite)

**DX-AS (DEEPX All-Suite)** is an integrated environment of frameworks and tools that enables inference and compilation of AI models using DEEPX devices. Users can build the integrated environment by installing individual tools, but DX-AS maintains optimal compatibility by aligning the versions of the individual tools.

## Quick Guide (Install and Run)

DX-Compiler provides scripts for local installation, as well as scripts for building Docker images and running containers.

### Local Installation
For detailed instructions on setting up a local environment for DX-Compiler, please refer to this [LINK](https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx-all-suite/blob/main/docs/source/02_Setting_Up_Environment.md).

### Faster Installation with uv

Pass `--uv=true` to `install.sh` to install Python packages with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead of pip:

```bash
./install.sh --uv=true
```

Add `--pypi=false` for a reproducible install pinned by the checked-in `uv.lock`:

```bash
./install.sh --uv=true --pypi=false
```

See [Installation of DX-COM](source/docs/02_02_Installation_of_DX-COM.md) for details.

### Docker Installation
For detailed instructions on setting up a Docker environment for DX-Compiler, please refer to this [LINK](https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx-all-suite/blob/main/docs/source/02_Setting_Up_Environment.md)

## Create User Manual

### Install Python Dependencies

To install the necessary Python packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-video pymdown-extensions mkdocs-with-pdf weasyprint==65.1 
```

### Generate Documentation (HTML and PDF)

To generate the user guide as both HTML and PDF files, execute the following command:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will create:
- **HTML documentation** in the `docs/` folder - open `docs/index.html` in your web browser
- **PDF file**: `DEEPX_DX-COM_UM_[version]_[release_date].pdf` in the root directory
