# RELEASE_NOTES

## DX-Compiler v2.5.0 / 2026-08-25

-   DX-COM: v2.5.0
-   DX-TRON: Removed

----------

> **⚠️ Removal Notice — DX-TRON**
>
> DX-TRON was deprecated in DX-Compiler **v2.4.0** and is **removed as of v2.5.0**. The `dx_tron` install target, the `dxtron` CLI/desktop AppImage, the web-server variant, and the `run_dxtron_web.sh` / `run_dxtron_appimage.sh` launcher scripts no longer ship with this package. Use the DX-COM **Compilation Summary Report** (`--export_html`) for model inspection and visualization.

Here are the **DX-Compiler v2.5.0** Release Notes.

### Installer

### 1. Changed

-   **DX-TRON Support Removed**: `--target=dx_tron` is no longer accepted by `install.sh` or `uninstall.sh`. Valid targets are now `dx_com` and `all`.
-   **DX-TRON Launcher Scripts Removed**: `run_dxtron_web.sh` and `run_dxtron_appimage.sh` were deleted.
-   **`compiler.properties` Simplified**: `TRON_VERSION` and `TRON_DOWNLOAD_URL` were removed, leaving only `COM_VERSION`. `install.sh` no longer reads or validates the DX-TRON properties.
-   **DX-TRON DEB Removal Is Now Manual**: `uninstall.sh` no longer runs `apt-get remove dxtron`. If the `dxtron` DEB package is still installed on a Debian/Ubuntu host, remove it with `sudo apt-get remove dxtron`.
-   **`--target=all` and `--target=dx_com` Converged in `uninstall.sh`**: with DX-TRON gone the two targets perform the same work. In `install.sh` they remain distinct — `all` skips the OS/architecture check in archive mode and probes silently, while `dx_com` checks strictly.
-   **Dead Installer Internals Removed**: `scripts/install_module.sh` and `scripts/downloader.py` were deleted. They implemented the tarball download / extract / symlink flow used only by the DX-TRON installer; DX-COM has always installed via `pip`.

### 2. Fixed

-   **Leftover `dx_tron/` Cleanup**: `uninstall.sh` removes a leftover `dx_tron/` directory or symlink from an earlier release whenever it uninstalls (`--target=dx_com` or the default `all`), so upgrading does not orphan it.

### 3. Added

-   **Explicit Message for the Removed Target**: passing `--target=dx_tron` now exits non-zero with a specific explanation instead of the generic "invalid target" error — `install.sh` points at `--target=dx_com` and the `--export_html` summary report, and `uninstall.sh` points at `sudo apt-get remove dxtron`. Existing scripts and CI jobs fail with the reason rather than a misleading message.

### Documentation

### 1. Changed

-   **Model Viewer Page Removed**: The *Model Viewer — DX-TRON* user manual page, its navigation entry and its four screenshots were removed. The page documented an install target, launcher scripts, and a binary that no longer ship, instructing readers to run commands that now fail. Use the *Compilation Summary Report* page instead.
-   **Compilation Summary Report Renumbered**: `04_02_Compilation_Summary_Report.md` became `04_Compilation_Summary_Report.md`, now that *Development Tools* holds a single document. All references were repointed.
-   **Validation Guidance Updated**: The agent-driven development knowledge base (`.deepx/`) and all generated platform instruction files now direct validation to `dxcom --export_html` and the resulting `<model_name>_summary.html` instead of DX-TRON inspection.

----------

## DX-Compiler v2.4.1 / 2026-07-27

-   DX-COM: v2.4.0
-   DX-TRON: v2.0.1 (Deprecated)

----------

Here are the **DX-Compiler v2.4.1** Release Notes. This is a documentation-only hotfix; no changes to DX-COM or DX-TRON binaries.

### Documentation

### 1. Fixed

-   Fixed broken internal links and reorganized several pages in the user manual for improved navigation.
-   Corrected the `dx_com.pre_optimize()` supported-model listings in the user manual: YOLOv10 is not a valid target and has been removed from the `yolo_postprocess` and PPU-type-2 migration guidance.

----------

## DX-Compiler v2.4.0 / 2026-06-16

-   DX-COM: v2.4.0
-   DX-TRON: v2.0.1 (Deprecated)

----------

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice — DX-TRON**
>
> Starting with DX-Compiler **v2.4.0**, **DX-TRON is deprecated** and will be removed in a future release. No further feature updates or bug fixes are planned for DX-TRON. We recommend migrating to the new **HTML graph viewer** bundled with DX-COM (see *Standalone HTML Graph Viewer* below) for model inspection and visualization.


> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice — PPU Type 2**
>
> Starting with DX-Compiler **v2.4.0**, the legacy **PPU type 2** post-processing mode (used for YOLOv8-family DFL post-processing) is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release. Compiling a model that uses PPU type 2 now emits a deprecation warning. Please migrate to the new **`dx_com.pre_optimize()` API** with the built-in YOLO post-processing passes (see *Added* below).

Here are the **DX-Compiler v2.4.0** Release Notes.

### DX-COM (v2.4.0)

### 1. Changed

-   **PPU Type 2 Deprecated**: The legacy PPU type 2 post-processing mode is now deprecated and emits a deprecation warning when used. See the Deprecation Notice above for the migration path.
-   **Faster, Lighter Compilation**: Reduced memory usage and improved compile time, especially on large models.
-   **Expanded Python Version Support**: In addition to Python 3.8–3.12, DX-COM now supports **Python 3.13 and 3.14**.

### 2. Fixed

-   Fixed a Python API issue where models expecting integer inputs were sometimes fed float data, causing accuracy degradation.
-   Fixed several Q-PRO / DXQ quantization crashes and stability issues observed on real models.
-   Fixed multiple compilation errors and runtime issues caused by tiling, partitioning, and memory allocation in models containing `Split`, `Concat`, `Reshape`, `Bilinear Resize`, `Clip`, or odd spatial dimensions.
-   Fixed compatibility issues with **NumPy 2.4+** and **onnxruntime ≥ 1.25.0**.
-   **Reduce ExpandDim Preprocessing In Config For GrayScale**: When converting to GrayScale color, one channel was automatically squeezed, which caused a dimensional difference compared to the RGB image. So additional ExpandDim preprocessing is needed before. Therefore, we resolve this problem and preprocessing config to be identical to that of RGB images.

### 3. Added

-   **Automated Q-PRO Configuration**: Q-PRO quantization (formerly available only by hand-picking DXQ combinations) is now much easier to use. DX-COM can now **automatically generate DXQ combinations** for you and run Q-PRO under the hood, removing the need to manually tune the many DXQ knobs to get higher-accuracy quantization.
-   **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Added end-to-end **QAT** support directly through `dx_com.compile()`. When the supplied config JSON includes a `qmaster` block, `dx_com.compile()` automatically switches to QAT mode and runs the training pipeline using the same dataset settings as PTQ calibration. Available from both the `dxcom` CLI and the Python API. A new `fast_run` flag is also available for quick QAT smoke tests.
-   **QXNN Resume (Re-quantization without Recompile)**: Added a checkpoint-based **QXNN resume** flow available from both the `dxcom` CLI and the Python API. Once a model has been compiled, users can re-run quantization with different settings (e.g., a different calibration method) without repeating the earlier compile phases, dramatically shortening the iteration loop when tuning quantization quality.
-   **Quantization Diagnosis Report (HTML)**: Added an HTML report that visualizes per-layer quantization quality, highlights problematic layers, and includes ready-to-paste compile snippets to retry compilation with recommended settings. Enabled via the new `quant_diagnosis` option, available from both the `dxcom` CLI and `dx_com.compile()`.
-   **Interactive HTML Graph Viewer (replaces DX-TRON)**: DX-COM now produces a standalone HTML viewer for inspecting compiled models, including parameter shapes, CPU/NPU partition reasons, and cross-subgraph connections. This replaces the DX-TRON workflow (see Deprecation Notice above).
-   **`dx_com.pre_optimize()` API**: Added a new top-level `dx_com.pre_optimize()` API for applying ONNX-level pre-processing transforms before compilation, with built-in support for **YOLO post-processing** integration (detection and segmentation modes). See the [Pre-Optimize API](source/docs/02_09_Pre_Optimize_API.md) chapter of the user manual.
-   **Ubuntu 26.04 Validation**: DX-COM is now validated on **Ubuntu 26.04**, in addition to the previously supported Linux distributions.
-   **DEEPX Agent-Driven Development (`dx-agent-dev`) — Beta**: Compile models with a natural-language prompt. An AI coding agent drives DX-COM to turn ONNX/`.pt` (including Ultralytics `format=deepx`) into a deployable `.dxnn`, with ONNX-vs-DXNN numerical verification. (Beta — behavior may change.)

### 4. Known Issues

-   Significant FPS degradation has been observed in models using PReLU as an activation function.

### Installer

### 1. Changed

-   **Expanded OS Support**: `install.sh` supported the **Red Hat family** — **Fedora 42–45**, **RHEL 9–10**, and **CentOS Stream 9–10** — in addition to **Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04/26.04** and **Debian 11–13**. Required repositories (CRB/PowerTools, EPEL) and build dependencies were set up automatically. Ubuntu 18.04 was no longer supported.
-   **Expanded Python Version Support**: The installer accepted **Python 3.8–3.14** (previously 3.8–3.12), installing a supported version via the system package manager or a source build when the OS default was unsuitable.
-   **Simplified DX-COM Installation**: DX-COM was installed as a published `pip` package, so a matching wheel no longer had to be selected per Python version. `compiler.properties` no longer carried per-Python download URLs.
-   **Fully Unattended Installation**: All interactive prompts were removed — the Python version confirmation and its 10-second timeout, plus package prompts such as the `tzdata` timezone selection. `install.sh` ran to completion without user input, making it usable in Dockerfiles and CI pipelines.

### 2. Fixed

-   Fixed the installer reporting success on an unsupported OS/architecture after creating a virtual environment. It stopped early with a clear message when neither DX-COM nor DX-TRON could be installed.
-   Fixed reinstallation failures caused by leftover files or broken symlinks from a previously interrupted install.
-   Improved installation error reporting: a failed dependency step failed immediately with the actual error, instead of surfacing later as an unrelated build error.

### 3. Added

-   **DX-TRON on the Red Hat Family (Web Only)**: On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, the web variant was installed and could be started with `./run_dxtron_web.sh`. The `dxtron` CLI/desktop build required FUSE and remained available on the Debian/Ubuntu family only.
-   **Installation in Minimal Container Images**: The installer worked in images without `sudo` (e.g. minimal UBI/RHEL images, or running as `root` in CI), instead of failing with `sudo: command not found`.

### DX-TRON (v2.0.1)

**Deprecated.** DX-TRON is deprecated as of DX-Compiler v2.4.0 and will be removed in a future release. Please migrate to the DX-COM standalone HTML graph viewer for model visualization. No changes in this release.

## DX-Compiler v1.0.0 Initial Release / 2025-07-23

-   DX-COM : v1.60.1
    
-   DX-TRON : v0.0.8
    

We're excited to announce the **initial release of DX-Compiler v1.0.0!**

DX-COM is a core component of the DEEPX SDK, designed to streamline your AI development workflow by efficiently converting pre-trained ONNX models into highly optimized `.dxnn` binaries for DEEPX NPUs. This initial release marks a significant step towards enabling low-latency and high-efficiency inference on DEEPX NPU hardware.

----------

### What's New?

This v1.0.0 release introduces the foundational capabilities of DX-COM:

-   **ONNX to** `.dxnn` **Conversion:** Seamlessly transforms your pre-trained ONNX models into a hardware-optimized `.dxnn` binary format.
    
-   **JSON Configuration Support:** Utilizes an associated JSON file to define crucial pre/post-processing settings and compilation parameters, giving you fine-grained control over the optimization process.
    
-   **Optimized for DEEPX NPU:** Generates `.dxnn` files specifically tailored for low-latency and high-efficiency inference on DEEPX Neural Processing Units.
    
-   **Includes** `dx_com` **module (v1.60.1):** This version of DX-Compiler bundles the `dx_com` module, providing the core compilation functionalities.
    
-   `dx_tron` **module (v0.0.8) available:** The `dx_tron` module is also part of DX-Compiler. While its official inclusion in the main release is planned for an upcoming version, you can download `dx_tron` (v0.0.8) today from [developer.deepx.ai](https://developer.deepx.ai/ "https://developer.deepx.ai/").
    

----------

### Key Role in the DEEPX SDK

DX-COM plays a pivotal role within the broader DEEPX SDK ecosystem, interacting closely with other components to provide a complete AI development toolchain:

-   **Complements DX-RT:** The compiled `.dxnn` files are directly consumable by **DX-RT (Runtime)** for execution on DEEPX NPU hardware.
    
-   **Integrates with DX ModelZoo:** Models from **DX ModelZoo** can be compiled using DX-COM for optimized performance on DEEPX NPUs.
    

----------

We believe DX-Compiler v1.0.0 will be an indispensable tool for developers looking to deploy high-performance AI applications on DEEPX NPUs with minimal effort.
