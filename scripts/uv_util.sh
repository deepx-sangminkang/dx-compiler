# uv (Astral) detection and bootstrap for dx-compiler install.sh.
#
# Exports two variables consumed by install.sh:
#   PIP_CMD            "pip"              | "uv pip"
#   PIP_UNINSTALL_CMD  "pip uninstall -y" | "uv pip uninstall"
#
# uv pip is CLI-compatible with pip for install/uninstall, so callers just
# swap the command prefix. Two exceptions are NOT routed through here:
#   - `pip download`: uv has no equivalent. Archive mode keeps pip.
#   - `pip uninstall`: uv never prompts, so it rejects `-y`.

# Pinned so the installer never pulls an unreviewed uv release.
UV_PIN="${UV_PIN:-0.12.2}"

# Set UV_NO_BOOTSTRAP=1 to probe only (used by tests and by offline CI).
UV_NO_BOOTSTRAP="${UV_NO_BOOTSTRAP:-0}"

uv_available() {
    command -v uv >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Where the standalone installer drops the uv binary.
UV_BOOTSTRAP_DIR="${UV_BOOTSTRAP_DIR:-${HOME}/.local/bin}"

# Make uv available. Returns non-zero on failure so the caller can fall back to
# pip instead of aborting the install.
#
# uv is fetched as a standalone binary rather than with `pip install uv`,
# because pip is not dependable at this point:
#   - Debian/Ubuntu ship PEP 668 EXTERNALLY-MANAGED markers that reject
#     `pip install` into the system Python, --user included, so on Ubuntu
#     24.04/26.04 the pip route always fails. Getting past it needs
#     --break-system-packages, which a customer-facing installer has no
#     business doing to a distro Python.
#   - Inside a virtualenv pip is usually present, but not always: a venv built
#     by `uv venv` without --seed has none, and bare `pip` then silently
#     resolves to the system pip and hits the case above.
# The standalone binary sidesteps both and touches no Python installation.
#
# The URL is pinned to UV_PIN so this never fetches an unreviewed release, and
# UV_NO_MODIFY_PATH keeps the installer out of the user's shell rc files.
